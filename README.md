# Block Land: The World Beyond
A game about platforming and falling blocks!  Woo!

## TODO:
- Main gameplay( side scroll action(?), enemies(?), etc ).
- Tune moving and jumping to feel better(possibly add coyote time?).
- Fix hit detection to include left, right, top, etc.
- Graphics!
- Make level transitions more smooth!!!
